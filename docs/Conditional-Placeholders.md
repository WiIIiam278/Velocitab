# Velocitab Conditional Placeholders Documentation

In order to use these placeholders, install MiniPlaceholders on your Velocity proxy, set the `formatter_type`
to `MINIMESSAGE`, and ensure `enable_miniplaceholders_hook` is set to `true`.

Conditional placeholders allow you to display different values based on certain conditions. The format
is `<velocitab_rel_condition|<condition>|<true>|<false>>`.

Currently, this system is only available for the `format` and `nametag` fields in the tab groups configuration.

If true, displays "Same health", else "Not same health".   | `Same health` or `Not same health`                     |

**Note:** For string comparisons, use double quotes `" "` or single quotes `' '`. For numerical comparisons, quotes are
not needed.
Also if you use `'` for quotes, you need to escape them with `''`. The same applies for `"` and `""`. Example: `''%player_name%''` or `"'%player_name%'"`
In order to use papi placeholders for target you need to use `''%target_player_name%''` in order to get `''%player_name%''` replaced with the target player's name.

If you want to use `:` as a character in the condition or in the true/false value, you need to replace it with `?dp?`. Example: `<velocitab_rel_condition:%player_health% == %target_player_health%:Value?dp?True:Value?dp?False>`.

# Example
If you want to compare audience player's health with target player's health, you can use the following configuration:
```yaml
format: "<velocitab_rel_condition:%player_health% == %target_player_health%:Same health:Not same health>"
```
