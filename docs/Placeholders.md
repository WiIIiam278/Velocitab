Velocitab supports a number of Placeholders that will be replaced with their respective proper values in-game. In addition to the set of provided default Placeholders, you can make use of PlaceholderAPI and MiniPlaceholder-provided placeholders through special hooks.

## Default placeholders
Placeholders can be included in the header, footer and player name format of the TAB list. The following placeholders are supported out of the box:

| Placeholder                     | Description                                                                                                                                       | Example            |

**Note:** `(tag)` stands for IETF language tag, used for localization of date and time placeholders. For example, `en-US` for American English, `fr-FR` for French, `it-IT` for Italian, etc.
You can find a list of common primary language subtags [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IETF_language_tag#List_of_common_primary_language_subtags).


### Customising server display names
You can make use of the `server_display_names` feature in `config.yml` to customise how server display name appear when using the `%server%` placeholder. In the below example, if a user is connected to a server with the name "`very-long-server-`name" and the player name format for the group that server belongs to includes a `%server%` placeholder, the placeholder would be replaced with "`VSLN`" instead of the full server name.

<details>
<summary>Server display names (config.yml)</summary>

```yaml
# Define custom names to be shown in the TAB list for specific server names.
# If no custom display name is provided for a server, its original name will be used.
server_display_names:
  very-long-server-name: VLSN
```
</details>

## PlaceholderAPI support
To use PlaceholderAPI placeholders in Velocitab, install the [PAPIProxyBridge](https://modrinth.com/plugin/papiproxybridge) library plugin on your Velocity proxy and all Minecraft spigot servers on your network, and ensure the PAPI hook option is enabled in your Velocitab [[Config File]]. You can then include PAPI placeholders in your formats as you would any of the default placeholders.

PlaceholderAPI placeholders are cached to reduce plugin message traffic. By default, placeholders are cached for 30 seconds (30000 milliseconds); if you wish to use PAPI placeholders that update more frequently, you can reduce the cache time in the Velocitab config.yml file by adjusting the `papi_cache_time` value.

## MiniPlaceholders support
If you are using MiniMessage [[Formatting]], you can use [MiniPlaceholders](https://github.com/MiniPlaceholders/MiniPlaceholders) with Velocitab for MiniMessage-styled component placeholders provided by other proxy plugins. Install MiniPlaceholders on your Velocity proxy, set the `formatter_type` to `MINIMESSAGE` and ensure `enable_miniplaceholders_hook` is set to `true`
You can also use [Relational Placeholders](Relational-Placeholders).
